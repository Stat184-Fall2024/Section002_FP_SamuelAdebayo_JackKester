# This github project is meant to get certain statistics on Electric Vehicles. The Initial CSV file used comes from data.gov.
# Within this file, we Created a histogram that gives us the average range of some of the top EV Makers (for example, Tesla and Nissan)
# We were most interested in Tesla models as Tesla is the face of EV. We compared the models to see if they had significantly different ranges.
