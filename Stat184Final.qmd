Research Question: 
At 95% confidence is there a significant difference between the male estimated suicide rate and the estimated female suicide rate (Suicide rate is per hundred thousand within each gender)

$$Contrast = \bar{y_{1*}} (Male) - \bar{y_{2*}}\ (Female)$$ 
Question Response:


```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(RCurl)
library(emmeans)

sr <- read.csv(text = getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat184-Fall2024/Section002_FP_SamuelAdebayo_JackKester/refs/heads/main/Death_rates_for_suicide__by_sex__race__Hispanic_origin__and_age__United_States.csv"))

sr_gender <- sr %>% 
  filter(STUB_LABEL %in% c("Male", "Female")) %>%
  filter(UNIT %in% c("Deaths per 100,000 resident population, crude")) %>%
  select(STUB_LABEL, YEAR, ESTIMATE) %>%
  rename(Gender = STUB_LABEL, Year = YEAR, Estimate = ESTIMATE)

boxplot(Estimate~Gender, data = sr_gender)



s_fit <- aov(Estimate~Gender, data = sr_gender)

k1 <- c(1,-1)

s_em <- emmeans(s_fit, "Gender", data = sr_gender)

lin_comb <- contrast(s_em, list(k1))
confint(lin_comb, adjust = "none")
```

At 95% confidence, because 0 is not within the confidence interval, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in suicide rates between men and women.
